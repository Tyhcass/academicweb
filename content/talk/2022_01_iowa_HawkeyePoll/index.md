## Description
Public opinion polls are a vital component of contemporary politics. The aim of this course is to help students learn the conceptual tools and practical skills required to design, conduct, and interpret surveys. Students in this course will help design and participate in the spring 2022 Hawkeye Poll. First, we will learn about polling procedures including sampling design, question wording, interpreting responses, and writing press releases and research reports. We will then implement this knowledge in web and telephone survey of Iowans age 18 and over that will ask respondents for their opinions and behaviors on a variety of political and policy-related topics.Calling will take place in the call center of the Iowa Social Science Research Center for about 8-10 hours for each student in April. Check more details on Hawkeye Poll's [website](https://clas.uiowa.edu/polisci/research/hawkeye-poll).
