## Abstract 

In the face of the COVID-19 crisis, what explains the variation policies adoption choices among Chinese provincial governments? To answer this question, we gathered new adoption data on twenty-five policies used to contain COVID-19 in China from December 31th, 2019 to March 18th, 2020. We also conducted state-of-the-art multilevel pooled event history analysis that allows us to control for policy heterogeneity. Our results demonstrate that variation in policy adoption during the crisis largely follows politics as usual: policies diffuse from the center to the provinces in the same way that regular, non-crisis policies diffuse. In addition, the characteristics of provincial leaders shape the pace of policy adoption. Our findings highlight the political dynamics of policy adoption and crisis response within China.
