## Abstract 

With the outbreak of COVID-19 in China, regional policy responses ranged from publishing new health statistics to restricting movement. Why do some policies diffuse more broadly than others? We argue that the location of policy burden and the national salience of COVID-19 explain policy adoption across provinces. 
We compile a new dataset on the speed of diffusion of 25 COVID-19 response and containment policies and assess whether each policy places a burden on the government, the public, or both. We employ multilevel pooled event history models that yield the best combination of unbiased estimates and standard errors to understand the diffusion of multiple COVID-19 policies. Our results demonstrate that as issue salience grows, the provincial governments are more likely to adopt the policies that burden both government officials and the public. The findings suggest policy responses in times of crisis are sensitive to the wider public attention.
