## Abstract 

Scholars who study governance in authoritarian countries have long highlighted
the importance of fiscal capacity and pressure from the central government
in determining the responsiveness and policy changes of subnational
governments. However, policy orientation is also important in shaping how
subnational governments react to a crisis. Using provincial governments’
responses during the 2018 Chinese vaccine scandal, I find strong evidence
that an emphasis on public health, as well as early responses by neighboring
provinces, increased the likelihood of a quick response. Moreover, issue
salience minimized the direct effect of pressure from the national government.
An additional paired case study of the provinces of Hubei and Hunan shows
that the importance accorded by the provincial government to public health
policy was implemented at the sub-provincial level through China’s one-leveldown
cadre management system; it also may explain Hubei’s delay in
responding to COVID-19 at an early stage.
