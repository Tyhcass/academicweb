Global public opinion toward international institutions seems to be shaky these days. For example, some people trust the World Health Organization but not others during the Covid-19 pandemic. The public becomes more suspicious of the United Nations as the world observes the challenge of the organization to maintain peace when a permanent member of the Security Council initiates war. Despite the importance of the issue, there have been only a few systematic studies of the factors that shape public trust in international organizations. This is surprising since a lack of trust in international organizations might hurt their effectiveness. Our research takes an exploratory approach to examine the heterogeneity of the trust levels in international organizations focusing on the United Nations. Using an original dataset drawn from 88 cross-national survey projects that cover 130 countries between 1995 and 2022, we hypothesize and test the impacts of human rights, development, and peacekeeping on peopleâ€™s trust in the United Nations. We find that domestic human rights conditions play a huge role when it comes to explaining the divergent level of trust in the United Nations.
