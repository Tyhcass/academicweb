This article focuses on a preliminary step in any ex-post data harmonization project---wrangling the pre-harmonized data---and suggests a practical routine for helping researchers reduce human errors in this often-tedious work. 
The routine includes three steps: (1) *T*eam-based concept construct and data selection; (2) Data entry *a*utomation; and (3) "Second-order" *o*pening---a "Tao" of data wrangling. 
We illustrate the routine with the examples of pre-harmonizing procedures used to produce the Standardized World Income Inequality Database (SWIID), a widely used database that uses Gini indices from multiple sources to create comparable estimates, and the Dynamic Comparative Public Opinion (DCPO) project, which creates a workflow for harmonizing aggregate public opinion data.
