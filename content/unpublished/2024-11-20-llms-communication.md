This project conducts a literature review of Large Language Models (LLMs) to explore how Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been discussed across sub disciplines of social
science, specifically in Communication and political science. A pertinent topic, the gap in literature reviews is addressed in this study. Furthermore, the comparison provides a baseline of
examination of key topics, differences, and the role of ethics and GenAI between the disciplines. The irony of utilizing computational methods in this paper is not lost and provides robust
methods of empirical examination. The implications lie in advancing research in LLMs in social science, while providing additional areas of research to examine.
