  Why don't all people accept vaccinations even during times of crisis? How can we understand the unchecked rise of economic inequality in so many countries, both democratic and authoritarian? My disseration explores the roles of societal attitudes, and specifically trust, play in policy outcomes. To overcome challenges of fragemented and spare data in comparative studies, I build a novel trust database and measure changes of public trust over time in countries around the world over the past half centure through Bayesian Dynamic Comparative Public Opinion method. I demonstrate that different types of trust have different roles in shaping public acceptance to vaccine and support for redistribution policy.
