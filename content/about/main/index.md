  In my dissertation, I seek to answer the question, "What influences public compliance with public policy?" More specifically, I ask, "Why do people not comply with a shared-interest policy which benefits both government and public generally, like public health policy? Why do people comply with a conflicting-interest policy in which there is a fundamental tension between the state and the society, like taxation?" I propose taking comparative trust and policy attributes to understand that different types of trust have reinforcing or counterbalancing effects on public compliance, and these effects vary across policy attributes. Drawing from 250 different survey datasets, I employ a sophisticated Bayesian IRT model, to measure four types of trust and create a comprehensive trust data set covering 151 countries over 47 years, from 1973 to 2020. I find that trust in implementing institutions has the most considerable effect on public compliance with vaccination but then the importance of political trust is at least matched by that of social trust on public compliance with taxation. My dissertation concludes that policymakers and policy implementors should rebuild public trust in preparing for governance challenges like future pandemics, infodemics, and climate change.
