  In my dissertation, I propose taking comparative trust and policy attributes to understand that different types of trust have reinforcing or counterbalancing effects on public compliance with policies, and these effects vary across policy attributes. I argue that trust in implementing institutions should be most important in policies where the state and public share the interest, such as vaccination while the importance of political trust will be at least matched by that of social trust in policies where the interests of state and society have a fundamental tension, such as taxation. Drawing from 250 survey datasets, I employ a sophisticated Bayesian IRT model, to measure trust in representative institution, trust in implementing institution, and generalized trust. I create a comprehensive trust data set covering 151 countries over 47 years, from 1973 to 2020. To identify the causal effects, I use causal graphs and run a dynamic fixed-effects model with system generalized method of moments estimator. I expect to find that trust in implementing institutions has the most considerable effect on compliance with vaccination. I contend the importance of political trust is at least matched by that of social trust on compliance with taxation. My dissertation can help scholars, policymakers and policy implementors understand better about and break the vicious circle of public distrust and deadlock of policy reform in order to prepare for governance challenges like future pandemics, infodemics, and climate change.
