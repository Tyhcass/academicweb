  In my dissertation, I seek to answer the question, "What influences public compliance with public policy?" More specifically, I ask, "Why do people not comply with a shared-interest policy which benefits both government and public generally, like public health policy? Why do people comply with a conflicting-interest policy in which there is a fundamental tension between the state and the society, like taxation?" Public opinion scholars have examined how political and social trust affect policy support and public compliance with policies, including redistribution policies, taxation, disease controls, and military recruitment etc., in single countries. I propose taking comparative trust and policy attributes to understand that different types of trust have reinforcing or counterbalancing effects on public compliance, and these effects vary across policy attributes.
