Thanks for stopping by!

I am a post-doctoral scholar in the Center for Social Data Analytics (C-SoDA) at Penn State University. I specialize in comparative politics and political methodology. My research centers on public opinion, elite behavior (misinformation), and Chinese politics. To better answer classic questions and understand new phenomena, for example, public support for democracy and online misinformation by elites, I use quantitative, automated, and computational techniques to analyze large-scale survey data and text data. 

My method interest includes latent variable measurements, Bayesian Analysis, NLP/Text-as-data, and machine-learning in non-traditional data.
