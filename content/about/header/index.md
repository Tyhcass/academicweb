I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Political Science at the University of Iowa. I specialize in comparative politics and political methodology. My research attempts to understand the interaction between public opinion and policymaking, policy output, policy outcomes and policy feedback as a process in governance from comparative perspective. Specificially, I focus on public health and redistribution policy. 

My method interets include latent variable measurements in public opinion and machine-learning in Non-traditional data. You can check out my [CV](https://github.com/Tyhcass/cvtemplate/blob/master/CassTai_CV.pdf) here and learn more about my research interests in [publications](/publication).
