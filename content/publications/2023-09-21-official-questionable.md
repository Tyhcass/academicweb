We study the roles of elected officials in the dissemination of misinformation on Twitter. This is a particularly salient online population since elected officials serve as primary sources of information for many stakeholders in the public, media, government, and industry. We analyze the content of tweets posted from the accounts of over 3,000 U.S. state lawmakers throughout 2020 and 2021. Specifically, we identify the dissemination of URLs linked to unreliable content. Our starkest finding is that Republicans share more misinformation than do Democrats by an order of magnitude. Additionally, we uncover distinct patterns in the temporal trends of tweets and tweets associated with misinformation across party and state lines. Delving into the content of tweets referencing unreliable URLs reveals discussions of election integrity, abortion, COVID-19 policies, and immigration. Furthermore, consistent with the literature on asymmetric polarization, Republicans exhibit a greater inclination toward engaging in partisan attacks. We also find that state lawmakers often tweet about state-specific topics. These findings enhance our understanding of misinformation, political communication, and state politics.
