Elected officials occupy privileged positions in public communication about important topics---roles that extend to the digital world. In the same way that public officials stand to lead constructive online dialogue, they also hold the potential to accelerate the dissemination of low-factual and harmful content. This study aims to explore and explain the sharing of low-factual content by examining nearly 500,000 Facebook posts by U.S. state legislators from 2020 to 2021. We validate a widely used low-factual content detection approach in misinformation studies, and apply the measure to all of the posts we collect. Our findings reveal that the prevalence is relatively rare, affecting less than one percent of legislators' posts overall. However, Republican legislators share low-factual content at higher rates, and certain states emerge as hotspots for such content. We also find that conservative lawmakers are more likely to share such content, with this tendency potentially intensifying in conservative districts, and waning in liberal ones. Furthermore, legislators in more professional legislatures, particularly with higher compensation, are less likely to spread low-factual content. We conclude with a discussion of how our results present implications for future interventions to reduce the spread of low-factuatl content.
