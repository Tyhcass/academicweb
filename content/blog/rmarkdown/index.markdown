## About DCPO

The study of comparative public opinion has been hampered by "incomparable" data. DCPO is an R package making "comparability" possible by using sophisticated Bayesian IRT method to estimate latent public opinion from cross-national survey data to maximize the information gleaned from available sources and overcome issues of missing data.

For a detailed description, see the working paper [here](https://github.com/fsolt/DCPO).
