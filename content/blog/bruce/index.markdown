## About GAiN

The GAiN Lab, directed by Bruce Desmarais, conducts research focused on rigorously and precisely identifying the complex ways in which political actors and institutions exhibit interdependence. Approximately half of the Lab's work involves the development of analytical methods capable of illuminating these dependencies. The other half involves applications in the study of interdependence in law and policymaking. The Lab's funding has been provided by the National Science Foundation, the Russel Sage Foundation and the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation.
