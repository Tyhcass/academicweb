title: "About me"
---

I am a political scientist and computational social scientist, working as an Assistant Research Professor and Assistant Director at the Center for Social Data Analytics (C-SoDA) at Penn State University.

My research focuses on measuring complex latent variables in political and social contexts, applying computational and statistical approaches to capture public opinion and elite behavior patterns.
By leveraging large language models and Bayesian analysis to analyze large-scale textual and survey data, I examine how citizens and state actors interact across various policy domains, including climate politics, both in the United States and in comparative contexts.


I am dedicated to delivering high-quality teaching.
My experience includes teaching graduate workshops and undergraduate courses in political science and social data analytics, with a focus on topics such as research design, quantitative methods, and advanced Bayesian analysis.

I earned my PhD in 2022 from the University of Iowa and subsequently served as a postdoctoral scholar at C-SoDA from 2022 to 2024 before transitioning to my current role.
