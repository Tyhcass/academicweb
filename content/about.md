title: "About me"
---

I am a political scientist and computational social scientist, working as an Assistant Research Professor and Assistant Director at the Center for Social Data Analytics (C-SoDA) at Penn State University.

My research focuses on governance and democratic accountability, with a particular emphasis on responsible AI in governance. 
I develop and evaluate humanâ€“AI pipelines that identify when automation fails and where human oversight is essential, and I build data infrastructure that enables transparent and scalable applications of AI in the social sciences. 
I also advance comparative public opinion research using Bayesian measurement models, generating cross-national data that enrich studies of governance.

I am dedicated to delivering high-quality teaching.
My experience includes teaching graduate workshops and undergraduate courses in political science and social data analytics, with a focus on topics such as research design, quantitative methods, and advanced Bayesian analysis.

I earned my PhD in 2022 from the University of Iowa and subsequently served as a postdoctoral scholar at C-SoDA from 2022 to 2024 before transitioning to my current role.
